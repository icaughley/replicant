## 0.5.2:
* Add EntityMessageEndpoint to abstract the endpoint to which the interceptor
  delivers EntityMessage instances. Adjust the AbstractReplicationInterceptor
  to deliver messages to endpoint.
* Add the EntityMessageGenerator interface to abstract over code responsible
  for generating EntityMessage instances.
* Import EntityMessageSorter to make it easier to share sorting mechanisms
  across projects that use replicant.

## 0.5.1:
* Include source in jar file to make it easier to integrate with GWT.

## 0.5:
* Remove the Async*Callback interfaces now that they are generated by Domgen.
* Move the RDate, Date*Serializer and Date*Deserializer classes to gwt-datatypes
  library.
* Move the org.realityforge.replicant.client.json.gwt.JsoReadOnly* collections
  to org.realityforge.gwt.datatypes.client.collections in the gwt-datatypes package.
* Add GwtDataLoaderService to simplify creating a DataLoader in GWT.
* Add template method AbstractDataLoaderService.shouldValidateOnLoad() that will
  validate the entity repository on each change. Useful to override and return true
  during development or in debug mode.

## 0.4.8:
* Change AbstractReplicationInterceptor so that subclasses must override a template
  method to provide the EntityManager. The purpose of this change is to allow for
  the use of this library in applications that have multiple persistence contexts.
