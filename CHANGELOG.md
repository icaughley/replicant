## 0.5.4:
* Add synchronized modifier to several methods of PacketQueue.
* Import AbstractSubscriptionManager and SubscriptionEntry to help manage
  client-side representation of subscriptions.
* Rework AbstractDataLoaderService so that incoming packets are only processed
  in sequence order.
* Ensure the AbstractDataLoaderService pauses or disables the broker after it
  has parsed the changeset.
* Initialize AbstractDataLoaderService._lastKnownChangeSet to 0 so sequence
  numbers are sequential.
* Throw an exception if null is passed into rawJsonData parameter of the
  AbstractDataLoaderService.enqueueDataLoad method.
* Fix bug in Packet.isLessThan().

## 0.5.3:
* Move EntityMessageAccumulator to the transport package and re-target it to
  deliver messages to the PacketQueue.
* Introduce the Packet and PacketQueue to support creating the transport layer.
* Add Gin module that defines EntityMessageBroker and EntityRepository instances.
* Update EntityChangeListener to add a callback method that is called when
  and entity is added to the system.
* Make EntityChangeBrokerImpl.shouldRaiseErrorOnEventHandlerError() final.

## 0.5.2:
* Add @Replicate annotation to help define interceptor in EE application.
* Link the ChangeRecorder to the EntityMessageGenerator to reduce boilerplate
  code in dependent projects.
* In EntityChangeBrokerImpl, default to raising an IllegalStateException if
  there is an error handling events but support suppression of exceptions via
  EntityChangeBrokerImpl.setRaiseErrorOnEventHandlerError().
* Add EntityMessageAccumulator to help collect and forward EntityMessages to
  the respective clients.
* Add EntityMessageEndpoint to abstract the endpoint to which the interceptor
  delivers EntityMessage instances. Adjust the AbstractReplicationInterceptor
  to deliver messages to endpoint.
* Add the EntityMessageGenerator interface to abstract over code responsible
  for generating EntityMessage instances.
* Import EntityMessageSorter to make it easier to share sorting mechanisms
  across projects that use replicant.

## 0.5.1:
* Include source in jar file to make it easier to integrate with GWT.

## 0.5:
* Remove the Async*Callback interfaces now that they are generated by Domgen.
* Move the RDate, Date*Serializer and Date*Deserializer classes to gwt-datatypes
  library.
* Move the org.realityforge.replicant.client.json.gwt.JsoReadOnly* collections
  to org.realityforge.gwt.datatypes.client.collections in the gwt-datatypes package.
* Add GwtDataLoaderService to simplify creating a DataLoader in GWT.
* Add template method AbstractDataLoaderService.shouldValidateOnLoad() that will
  validate the entity repository on each change. Useful to override and return true
  during development or in debug mode.

## 0.4.8:
* Change AbstractReplicationInterceptor so that subclasses must override a template
  method to provide the EntityManager. The purpose of this change is to allow for
  the use of this library in applications that have multiple persistence contexts.
